# FFTW.jl

This package provides Julia bindings to the [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) library for
fast Fourier transforms, as well as functionality useful for signal processing.
These functions were formerly a part of Base Julia.

The FFTW library will be downloaded on versions of Julia where it is no longer distributed
as part of Julia.
Note that FFTW is licensed under GPLv2 or higher (see
[its license file](http://www.fftw.org/doc/License-and-Copyright.html)), but the bindings
here are licensed under MIT.
